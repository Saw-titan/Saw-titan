Welcome to my cozy corner of the internet! I'm a **B.Tech student** who's madly in love with all things web. I turn ☕ into code and wild ideas into reality—armed with nothing but **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and a **spark of curiosity**. 💡✨

## 🔧 Tech Toolkit

- 🧁 **HTML** — My first love. I structure like a queen/king.
- 🎨 **CSS** — Styling things until they scream *"aesthetic!"*
- ⚡ **JavaScript** — I make your buttons dance and websites talk back.

- Interactive CVs that look like **video games**  
- Quirky tools that solve problems you didn’t know you had  

Stay tuned — my GitHub is where logic meets whimsy! 🪄✨
